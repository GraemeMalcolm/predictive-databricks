## Implementing Predictive Analytics with Spark in Azure Databricks
A few years ago, I wrote and recorded the edX course [Implementing Predictive Analytics with Spark in Azure HDInsight](https://www.edx.org/course/implementing-predictive-analytics-with-spark-in-azure-hdinsight), which teaches you how to use the Spark MLLib library to build machine learning solutions in a Spark Azure HDInsight cluster.

Microsoft now also offers Spark capabilities in the **Azure Databricks** service. This repo contains versions of the lab files that have been modified to use Azure Databricks.
